/**
 * skill-family-contracts: the single authority for machine-readable structures,
 * protocols, stable error codes, and the protocol-name registry.
 *
 * v1 is frozen: thirty-two top-level object schemas (the migration-manifest
 * contract was added in 1.1.0; the report-model and report-binding contracts
 * were added in 1.2.0; eight host-integration contracts were added in 1.3.0;
 * two durable-state contracts were added in 1.4.0; the token-estimate-result
 * and surface-scan-policy contracts were added in the same 1.4.0 delivery;
 * the declared-read-surface-result and structured-scan-policy contracts were
 * added in 1.5.0 per FND-ADR-010 / FND-ADR-011; the timeout-policy and
 * watchdog-termination-envelope contracts were appended under the same 1.5.0
 * version per FND-ADR-012, append-only without a version bump; the
 * public-boundary-declaration, platform-difference-registry,
 * observation-scope, profile-adoption-declaration, audit-baseline-pin and
 * token-estimate-record contracts were added in 1.6.0 per the audit
 * remediation C5 delivery; the project-profile contract was added in 1.7.0
 * per FND-ADR-013; the source-authority-receipt contract was added in 1.8.0;
 * filesystem operation contracts were added in 1.9.0),
 * one kernel protocol, a closed set of nine
 * mechanical check types, and a bounded mandatory rule set. Validation is
 * implemented entirely on Ajv (dialect-aware), never on a hand-written
 * schema-subset interpreter.
